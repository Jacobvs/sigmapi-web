# Sigma Pi Gamma Iota Chapter's website

This Python Django application powers the Sigma Pi Gamma Iota Chapter's website, which can be found at: https://sigmapigammaiota.org/

This project uses [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to keep the build environment standard between developers. In particular, I would recommend you install [Vagrant 1.6.3](https://www.vagrantup.com/download-archive/v1.6.3.html).
