		Sigma Pi is very concerned with the activities and proceedings of the WPI community.
		</p>

		<p>
		We strongly believe in the value of giving back to our community and each year we partake in many different service-oriented events.

	<h2>ACE Project</h2>
	<div class="text-block">

		<p>
		Every year, we look forward to our ACE project.  ACE, or Altruistic Campus Experience, is an annual effort by all Sigma Pi chapters to give back in a meaningful way to the community.  
		</p>
		<p>
		According to the "I Believe" manual, the ACE project "is the first international service project devoted to benefiting the faculty, administration, or host institution of the campus where individual chapters are located."
		</p>
		<p>
		The ACE project is "designed to help encourage our chapter members to develop pride and respect for their alma mater, while giving something back to the Fraternity's host institution. Each chapter is encouraged to conduct a service event that is specifically designed to benefit their campus. By becoming directly involved with our universities we hope to not only develop our members into better students, we also want to produce loyal alumni who will continue to give back to their alma mater long after each of them has graduated."

	<h2>Guitar-A-Thon</h2>
	<div class="text-block">
		<p>
		In the fall of each year, we hold our annual Guitar-A-Thon event with the assistance of the brothers of Phi Sigma Kappa.  
		At this event, we work towards raising money for the <a href="http://amazingdayfoundation.org/"> Sean Feliciano Amazing Day Foundation</a> in order to raise awareness of and prevent suicides of college students.
