        <h2>Founding</h2>
        <div class="text-block">

            <p>Gamma Iota chapter began in 1963 as Psi Theta Nu Fraternity, a local fraternity comprised of like-minded
                individuals at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. </p>

            <p>
                As a local fraternity, "PTN" had no overarching organization to support it. After vetting fraternities
                across the country for one year, PTN decided to apply to become a chartered and recognized chapter of
                Sigma Pi Fraternity. After another year, on May 1st, 1965, Psi Theta Nu received its charter from Sigma
                Pi Fraternity.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thus began the chapter's identity as Sigma Pi - Gamma Iota. Today, our alumni housing corporation still
                bears the name of our chapter's heritage: Psi Theta Nu.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before becoming home to Gamma Iota chapter, our historic chapter house had purportedly served as the WPI
                President's house and the campus police station. We believe the house to be over 110 years old --
                needless to say, it has been renovated over the years! Our house is located at 34 Institute Rd. or 17
                Dean St.

        <h2>Present Day</h2>
        <div class="text-block">
            <p>
                The Gamma Iota chapter of Sigma Pi continues to maintain an actively positive existence at Worcester
                Polytechnic Institute. True to our motto, which is based in the idea of perpetual progress, we strive to
                continuously improve our chapter while still holding true to our values and traditions.
