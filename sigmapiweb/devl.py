""" 
devl.py -- The more cross-platform makefile substitute with setup tools

Usage
=====
For first-time setup of this file, type 'python devl.py' 

How to Add Functionality
========================

User Variables
--------------
To add a new user variable, you should

- Update the ``user_variables`` dict in this module with the new key and a default value

This will make the variable available in calls to vformat() and format_and_call()

Commands
--------
To add a new command, you should

- Update the ``commands`` dict in this module
  - The key is the name of the command
  - The value is list containing other command names and/or functions which the command depends upon
- Prefix any new command functions with 'r_' (for 'run') for consistency
- Add a description of any new command functions using the `describe` decorator
- Avoid pipes, redirects, or otherwise bash-y things for our Windows friends. Instead, just use multiple commands
  and rely on Python's baked-in io functionality. See r_dumpdata() and r_pylint() for examples.
